I am a photographer living in wonderful New Zealand.  I have a passion for sharing the wonders of the natural world one image at a time.

Having recently purchased a campervan I am now travelling and re-discovering how wonderful New Zealand is.
On this site you will find some of my favourite images which are mainly animal related with some landscape / sea scapes as well.
I will also post the occasional blog of our local travells especially when these ttravels result in memorable images.

I can be found on: <br>
